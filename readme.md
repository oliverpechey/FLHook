# FLHook - A Server Improvement for Freelancer
[![Build](https://github.com/fl-devs/FLHook/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fl-devs/FLHook/releases/latest/download/Release.zip) [![Discord](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/discord?icon=discord&label)](https://discord.com/invite/c6wtsBk) [![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained%3F-yes-green.svg)](https://github.com/fl-devs/FLHook/graphs/commit-activity) [![Website shields.io](https://img.shields.io/website-up-down-green-red/http/shields.io.svg)](https://the-starport.net/)


## Installation
**N.B. FLHOOK ONLY WORKS WITH THE 1.1 PATCH INSTALLED. USING IT WITH 1.0 WILL CRASH FLSERVER!**

For the purpose of this readme, your Freelancer root installation folder (e.g. by default `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Freelancer`) will be referred to as `.`.

1. Copy all files from `dist\$Configuration` to your `.\EXE` directory. You may selectively remove some of the default plugins as desired.
2. Edit `.\EXE\FLHook.ini` as required.
3. Edit `.\EXE\dacomsrv.ini` and append `FLHook.dll` to the `[Libraries]` section.
4. FLServer should now load FLHook whenever you start it!

## Plugin Installation

Typically, plugins are distributed as DLL files (or archives with a DLL and configuration files).
The plugin DLL needs to be in `.\EXE\flhook_plugins`. Verify with the plugin's documentation for additional setup steps.

## Configuration

All configuration options are found in `.\EXE\FLHook.ini` and are documented therein. Note that plugins may create additional options, either in this file or elsewhere. Refer to the plugin's documentation for more information.

## User Commands

User commands may be entered in game by every player in chat and can be enabled or disabled in the INI config. Enter them in game to get a description, and use `/help` to list all of them.

## Compiling

Starting with version 2.1, Visual Studio 2019 is required. To compile, simply build the solution as normal. The final build will be found in `dist`, whereas intermediate files are located in `int` and `bin`.

If you wish to develop a new plugin within the solution, it is highly recommended to follow the existing structure, imitate current plugins' project settings, and import the `Plugin Common` properties sheet.

If you would like the build process to copy FLHook as well as any enabled plugin, you may set the `FLHOOK_COPY_PATH` environment variable to your `.\EXE` directory. If it is not set, no such copy will occur. Unlike the `dist` folder structure, no configuration subfolder will be created, so Debug and Release builds will overwrite one another.

### Compiling Generator

The Generator project should rarely need to be recompiled since it's only used to generate some seldom-changed files. If this is necessary, some extra steps are needed to support it.

1. Set the solution to "Generator". This will suspend building other projects.
2. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/foonathan/cppast#installation-on-windows) to setup llvm, clang and `llvm-config`. Change the generator for cmake as required (e.g. Visual Studio 2019 instead).
3. Build solution as normal.

### Compiling Instructions

1. Install Visual Studio 2019
2. Clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
3. Run bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
4. In this directory, run `.\vcpkg integrate install`
5. Clone this repository
6. Open `project\FLHook.sln`
7. Ensure you are on `Release` and build the solution.

## Visual Studio Extension

A visual studio extension is available to ease the plugin creation process. A new project template named "FLHook Plugin Template" will create a ready to use FLHook plugin project for you.

The extension is available on the visual studio marketplace here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Alley.flhook-plugin-templates

You can also build it yourself with the project located in misc/flhook_vsix.

## Contributing and Support

Merge requests are welcome. The old Forge SVN repositories are no longer tracked and will not be merged into this repository unless the commit author also creates a merge request here.

For any and all support, please visit https://the-starport.net and look for the FLHook forums. Github issues are available for bug reports *only*.
