# Recommended Visual Studio Extensions
Below is a list of extensions we recommend you install before starting development on a plugin.

## FLHook Plugin Template
This eases the plugin creation process. A new project template named "FLHook Plugin Template" will create a ready to use FLHook plugin project for you.

The extension is available on the visual studio marketplace here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Alley.flhook-plugin-templates

You can also build it yourself with the project located in misc/flhook_vsix.
